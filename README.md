# hello-world
## My name is Ingrid, I am currently enrolled in Boston University's Online Masters of Data Science. I am excited to be here. I am currently in the process of transitioning out of the classroom. I was a math teacher for Boston Public Schools for the past three years. I will be a learning specialist at a school in a neighboring city. I am looking forward to all of the things I will be learning this year.
